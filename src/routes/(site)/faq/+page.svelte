    <h3>How To Play</h3>
    <div class="panel">
        <div class="panel-inner">
            These pages are (mostly) straight translations of the How To Play and FAQ on the official site, containing
            tutorials as well as details and clarifications for various rules and Skills, with some reorganisation and a
            few extra notes. If you are confused about a certain aspect of the game or you run into a situation where it
            is unclear how exactly a Skill should be resolved, maybe your question is already answered here!<br /><br />
            While official events will be played as described here, the official help pages state that you don't have to
            exactly follow what it says in casual play. The content of these pages describe how the game's designers interpret
            the rules, but as long as you talk it out with the other players and everyone agrees, they encourage you to experiment
            with slight changes, and see whether you can make some new discoveries that'll help you enjoy SIC even more ♪
