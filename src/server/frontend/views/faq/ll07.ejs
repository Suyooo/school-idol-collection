                What happens if I <%- skillFormat("⟪ENTER⟫") %> this card with less than three cards in my Deck?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                Even if you have less than three cards in your Deck, you can add one Member without Stars to your Hand
                and return the rest to the bottom of your Deck.
                However, even if all of them have no Stars, you cannot take another turn, as the requirement for that
                effect calls for "three cards without Stars" to be shown.

                If I only have one face-up Song card in my Set List, can I flip one face-down Song card face-up?

            <div class="answer">
                Yes. The "all your face-up Song cards have the same Attribute" requirement is met in this case, so you
                can flip one face-down Song card face-up.

                What does "Member with the same Pieces" mean?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                It means a Member who has the exact same number including Piece attributes as another Member.
                The order of Pieces does not matter, so if you <%- skillFormat("⟪ENTER⟫") %>ed a Member
                with <%- skillFormat("[SMILE][PURE], you can ⟪ENTER⟫") %> another Member

            <div class="answer">
                Yes. When the Birthday Bonus is active, the bonus Pieces are added to that card, so in this example, you
                can <%- skillFormat("⟪ENTER⟫") %> <a href="/card/LL07-051/">LL07-051 "Yoshiko Tsushima"</a>.
